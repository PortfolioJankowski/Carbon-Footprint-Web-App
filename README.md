# Carbon-Footprint-Web-App
Capstone project from the Data Analysis and Mining in R course.
I merge 4 CSV files created in the format of tables in a relational database. I use R Shiny to create a web application, and design its appearance using HTML and CSS. The application consists of an introductory section, a visualization of carbon footprint calculations, an interactive decarbonization section for the obtained results, and a section presenting the data used in the project.
